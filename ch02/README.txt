Grails in Action - Chapter 2 examples
-------------------------------------

In addition to the scripts and classes added to the qotd Grails application,
we have also included some plain Groovy scripts in this directory. To run them,
simply execute

  groovy <filename>

from the command line. For example:

  groovy closures.groovy

These examples give you more insight into Groovy's syntax and the Groovy JDK.

*Note* CopingWithLineBreaks.groovy doesn't compile. This is intentional! The
file includes explanations on how to fix the compilation errors and why they
occur.
